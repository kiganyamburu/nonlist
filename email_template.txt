Subject: Request for CRSP and Compustat Data - Project 2

Dear Professor/TA [Name],

I am working on Project 2 (Cost of Equity Estimation for Non-Listed Firms) and need access to the required datasets:

1. **CRSP Data**: Monthly stock returns from January 2015 to December 2020
   - Variables needed: CUSIP, RET, EWRETD
   - Filters: Non-missing CUSIP and RET

2. **Compustat Data**: Annual fundamentals for fiscal year 2020
   - Variables needed: FYEAR, FYR, CUSIP, SIC, DT, PRCC_F, CSHO
   - Filters: FYR=12, non-missing CUSIP and SIC, DT>=0, PRCC_F>0, CSHO>0

Could you please provide these datasets or let me know how I can access them? I would prefer CSV format if possible.

Thank you for your assistance!
